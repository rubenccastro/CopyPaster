# CopyPaster
CopyPaster is a tool designed to facilitate the repetitive copying and pasting of a specific file from a source path (X) to a destination path (Y). \
This tool simplifies the process by automatically generating a .bat file.

## Usage
ATENTION: It copies the content inside the file e.g. <code> E:\Test-1\Content-Inside-Test-1 </code>.
 - Begin by copying the path of the file you wish to copy e.g. <code> E:\Test-1\ </code> and paste the copied source path into the designated input. 
 - Similarly, copy the destination path e.g. <code> E:\Test-2\ </code> and paste the copied source path into the designated input.


The destination path functions in the same manner as the source path, ensuring a seamless copying process. 

After the .bat file is generated, all you need to do is just run over and over the .bat!
